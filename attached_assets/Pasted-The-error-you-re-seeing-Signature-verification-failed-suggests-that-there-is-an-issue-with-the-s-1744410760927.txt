The error you're seeing, "Signature verification failed", suggests that there is an issue with the signing process for the staking transaction. Specifically, it's indicating that the public key 9qELzct4XMLQFG8CoAsN4Zx7vsZHEwBxoVG81tm4ToQX is missing the appropriate signature when trying to transfer tokens.

Here are a few potential causes and solutions for this issue:

1. Signer Missing in the Transaction
The most common reason for this error is that the wallet doesn't properly sign the transaction. This can happen if the signer (the wallet) hasn't been added correctly to the transaction. Make sure that:

The transaction is being signed by the correct wallet or signer before it's sent.

If you're using a multi-signature wallet or a separate authority, ensure that the correct signatures are included.

Solution: Check the code where the transaction is created and ensure that the signer (public key) is included and correctly passed to the sendTransaction function in @solana/web3.js.

javascript
Copy
Edit
const transaction = new Transaction().add(stakingInstruction);
const signature = await connection.sendTransaction(transaction, [payerKeypair], { skipPreflight: false });
Ensure that [payerKeypair] contains the correct keypair for signing.

2. Incorrect Authority or Missing Keypair
If you're transferring tokens or interacting with token accounts, ensure that the correct authority keypair is available. You might be using the wrong authority keypair or have not included the signer in the transaction.

Solution:

Double-check that the public key 9qELzct4XMLQFG8CoAsN4Zx7vsZHEwBxoVG81tm4ToQX is the correct signer for the transaction.

Ensure that the wallet being used has sufficient permissions for staking and can sign the transaction properly.

3. Wallet Connection Issue
If you're using a wallet (like Phantom or Solflare), ensure that it's properly connected and authorized to sign transactions. Sometimes, the wallet session may expire or not be properly initialized.

Solution:

Recheck the wallet connection logic.

Ensure that the wallet has been successfully connected and that the user has signed the necessary authorization steps before sending the transaction.

4. Token Transfer Logic
The issue may also be related to the specific logic you are using to transfer the tokens (e.g., minting, staking instructions, etc.). Ensure that the transaction logic for staking tokens is correct, and that all necessary signatures and instructions are being included.
