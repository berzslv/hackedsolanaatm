It seems that there could be several places where the issue might be occurring. Here are some possible reasons why Solana might not be getting deducted when purchasing your token:

1. Transaction Creation Issue:
Ensure that the Solana transaction is being created and signed correctly. You are using a VersionedTransaction, but it’s important to verify that the transaction is being created with the correct feePayer and includes the correct token transfer logic.

Check if the transaction is correctly constructed: Ensure that you are properly serializing the transaction and adding the appropriate instructions to it. You should have a transfer instruction to move SOL from the buyer’s wallet to the contract (or another wallet).

Here’s a quick check of transaction construction:

typescript
Copy
Edit
const transaction = new Transaction();
transaction.add(
  SystemProgram.transfer({
    fromPubkey: publicKey,
    toPubkey: recipientAddress,
    lamports: amount * LAMPORTS_PER_SOL, // Convert SOL to lamports
  })
);
Transaction sending: The sendTransaction method should be called after the transaction is properly signed and serialized. The transaction should also include the buyer's wallet as the feePayer.

Double-check that you're correctly handling the sendTransaction logic:

typescript
Copy
Edit
const signedTransaction = await sendTransaction(transaction);
2. Balance Check:
You are checking if the buyer has enough balance with:

javascript
Copy
Edit
if (inputAmount > balance) {
  toast({
    title: "Insufficient balance",
    description: `You don't have enough SOL. Your balance: ${formatNumber(balance, {decimals: 4})} SOL`,
    variant: "destructive",
  });
  setIsProcessing(false);
  return;
}
Ensure that the balance is being correctly fetched from the useSolana hook and contains the accurate value. If the balance isn't updated correctly after a transaction, the amount might appear as sufficient even though it’s not.

3. Transaction Confirmation & Fee Calculation:
Fee Issue: You calculate the fee based on the referral code (referralCode ? 0.06 : 0.08). Make sure that when calculating the final amount of SOL to be deducted, you are applying the fee and deducting the correct amount.

SOL Amount Calculation: Ensure that when you calculate the effectiveSolAmount after applying the fee, you are correctly passing that value into the transaction.
