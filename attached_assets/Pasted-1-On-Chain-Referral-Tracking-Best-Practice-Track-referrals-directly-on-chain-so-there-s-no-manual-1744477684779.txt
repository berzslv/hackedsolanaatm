1. On-Chain Referral Tracking (Best Practice)
Track referrals directly on-chain so there's no manual tracking, no cheating, and it's publicly verifiable.

✅ How to do it:
Create a mapping:

ts
Copy
Edit
referrer => [referred wallets, total referred amount, earned rewards]
Store the referrer in each buyer's state account at first buy.

Prevent changing referrer after the first purchase.

💡 Benefit:
You can distribute rewards automatically and allow public tools (like leaderboards) to verify everything on-chain.

💸 2. Fee Distribution Logic in Token Contract
When a buy happens:

Collect a fee (e.g. 8% total).

Split it:

5% → Referrer

1% → Marketing wallet

2% → Stakers

This logic should live in the token transfer / buy handler smart contract, so it's automatic and tamper-proof.

🎁 3. Referral Reward Claiming System
Let users claim referral earnings from the contract, or auto-distribute every X minutes.

Option A: Manual Claim
Cheaper gas, but requires users to click “claim”.

Option B: Auto-Payout
Distribute rewards to referrers on each purchase, or batch every 30 mins.

🧱 4. Smart Contract Setup
Split the logic into clear contracts:

Referral Tracker – stores who referred whom and tracks volume.

Token Handler – handles buys and triggers reward splits.

Staking Vault – receives and distributes the 2% staking fees.

Optional:

Leaderboard Contract – tracks top referrers.

👤 5. One-Time Referral Binding
To prevent gaming the system:

Bind referrer only on first token buy.

Don’t allow changing referrer afterward.

Users without a referrer → all fees go to marketing/staking.

🌐 6. Referral Link Format
Use base58 encoding or URL query:

perl
Copy
Edit
https://yourtoken.com/?ref=AKIPB0
Backend or frontend extracts the code, passes it to smart contract during buy.

🔒 7. Security and Anti-Exploit Tips
Limit one referral reward per wallet (no multi-accounts).

Don’t allow self-referrals.

Use on-chain referral registration to avoid backend abuse.
