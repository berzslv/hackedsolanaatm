 Fix Checklist for Solana sendTransaction "Unexpected error"
✅ 1. Log Everything Right Before sendTransaction
In combined-smart-contract-client.ts, near line 493 where you call:

ts
Copy
Edit
const txid = await wallet.sendTransaction(transaction, connection);
Add this right before:

ts
Copy
Edit
console.log("🚀 Sending transaction:", transaction);
console.log("🧾 Fee payer:", transaction.feePayer?.toBase58());
console.log("🔑 Signers:", transaction.signatures.map(s => s.publicKey.toBase58()));
console.log("🔗 Network:", connection.rpcEndpoint);
console.log("💼 Wallet public key:", wallet.publicKey?.toBase58());
✅ 2. Make Sure You're Setting the feePayer
If you're constructing a Transaction() manually, set the fee payer:

ts
Copy
Edit
transaction.feePayer = wallet.publicKey;
And add a blockhash:

ts
Copy
Edit
const { blockhash } = await connection.getLatestBlockhash();
transaction.recentBlockhash = blockhash;
If either of those is missing — the wallet will fail silently!

✅ 3. Simulate the Transaction
Before sending it with the wallet, try:

ts
Copy
Edit
const simulation = await connection.simulateTransaction(transaction);
console.log("🔍 Simulation result:", simulation);
If it logs something like:

r
Copy
Edit
Instruction 0 failed: missing required signature
…you’ll instantly know what’s wrong.

✅ 4. Try Catch With Deeper Error Logging
Replace your catch (err) block with this:

ts
Copy
Edit
} catch (err: any) {
  console.error("🧨 Staking failed:", err);
  if (err.logs) console.log("📄 Logs:", err.logs);
  if (err.message) console.log("📢 Message:", err.message);
  if (err instanceof WalletSendTransactionError) {
    console.log("👛 Wallet error details:", err);
  }
  throw new Error(`Failed to process staking transaction: ${err.message || "Unknown error"}`);
}
This might expose more metadata from the wallet adapter.

✅ 5. Double Check Wallet and Network Match
In your frontend, make sure the Solana connection and wallet are aligned:

ts
Copy
Edit
const connection = new Connection(clusterApiUrl("devnet"));
And check wallet is on Devnet (Phantom can silently reject otherwise).

✅ 6. Check PDA or Account Seeds
If your staking instruction involves a PDA (e.g. global_state or vault_account), confirm:

The seeds used are correct

You're using the same bump as in the smart contract

You're passing the PDA to the instruction in the right position

If a PDA is wrong or out of order, it won’t throw a nice error — just "unexpected error."
