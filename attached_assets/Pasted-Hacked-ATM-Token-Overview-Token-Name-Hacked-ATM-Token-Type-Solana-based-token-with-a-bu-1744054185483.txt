Hacked ATM Token Overview:

• Token Name: Hacked ATM

• Token Type: Solana-based token with a built-in referral system and staking vault.



Key Features:



Referral System:

1. Referral Fee:

• When users buy or sell Hacked ATM using refferal code or link, a total of 6% fee is applied.

• 3% of the 6% fee goes directly to the referrer (the person who shared the referral link).

• 1% of the 6% fee goes to a marketing wallet to support the project.

• 2% of the 6% fee is collected and used to reward stakers in the staking vault. The 2% is distributed every 30 minutes to users who have staked their tokens, and the rewards are auto-compounded into their staked balance.

2. Without Referral

• When users buy or sell Hacked ATM without refferal code or link, a total of 8% fee is applied.

• 2% of the 8% fee goes to a marketing wallet to support the project.

• 6% of the 8% fee is collected and used to reward stakers in the staking vault. The 2% is distributed every 30 minutes to users who have staked their tokens, and the rewards are auto-compounded into their staked balance.



3. Referral Tracking:

• Track referrals on-chain to ensure proper reward distribution.
• Each new wallet connected will get a new referral link and code only for his wallet. It should be tracked in database probably.



Staking Vault:

1. Dynamic APY:

• The APY for stakers will be dynamic, meaning it will adjust based on the transaction volume (2% of every buy and sell) and the total amount of Hacked ATM tokens staked in the vault.

• More transactions = Higher APY.

• More tokens staked = Lower APY.

• The APY will auto-adjust based on the fees collected and vault balance, ensuring a flexible, sustainable reward system.

• Auto-compounding: Staking rewards will automatically be compounded every 30 minutes into the user’s staked balance.

2. Early Withdrawal Fee:

• If users unstake their Hacked ATM tokens within 7 days, a 4% fee of the amount they have staked will be burned automatically, 1% goes to marketing.

• This fee is designed to discourage early unstaking and help with token scarcity.



Leaderboard & Rewards:

1. Leaderboard:

• Weekly and Monthly Leaderboards will track and display the top 3 referrers and top 3 stakers.

• Top 3 Referrers: Based on the number of referrals or the transaction volume generated from their referrals.

2. Rewards for Top Users:
