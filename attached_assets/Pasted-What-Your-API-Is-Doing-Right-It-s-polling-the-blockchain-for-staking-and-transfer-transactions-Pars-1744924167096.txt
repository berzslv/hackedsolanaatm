What Your API Is Doing Right
It's polling the blockchain for staking and transfer transactions

Parses logs to detect events like stake, unstake, claim

Saves staking info per wallet to a JSON file (staking_data.json)

Provides /api/staking-data?wallet=... to fetch staked info

⚠️ Likely Reason Staked Balance is Missing
The backend depends entirely on log parsing to detect events:

js
Copy
Edit
if (logText.includes('Program log: Instruction: stake')) {
  eventType = 'stake';
}
But this only works if:

The log actually says "Program log: Instruction: stake"

Your smart contract includes a line like:

rust
Copy
Edit
msg!("Instruction: stake");
🧪 How to Confirm
Open your smart contract (lib.rs) and check your stake function. You should see something like this:

rust
Copy
Edit
pub fn stake(ctx: Context<Stake>, amount: u64) -> Result<()> {
    msg!("Instruction: stake");
    ...
}
If it’s missing, the backend won’t detect stakes.

✅ Fix Option 1: Add Log Markers to Smart Contract
To ensure backend detects your stake transactions, add logs like this:

rust
Copy
Edit
msg!("Instruction: stake");
msg!("Staking amount: {}", amount);
msg!("owner: {}", ctx.accounts.owner.key());
Do this for:

stake

unstake

claim_rewards

compound_rewards

These make parsing easy and reliable.

✅ Fix Option 2: Use Account Fetching Instead of Just Logs
For better accuracy, update your backend to:

Derive the user’s staking PDA (e.g., user_stake_info)

Fetch the actual account from chain using Anchor/Web3

Deserialize and get the current staked_amount, rewards, etc.

That way you don’t depend on logs anymore.

I can help you implement this if you share your staking PDA layout or IDL.

🛠️ Quick Check
Also verify this:

json
Copy
Edit
GET /api/staking-data?wallet=YourWalletHere
If it shows amountStaked: 0 even after you stake, your backend didn't parse the logs.

✅ What to Do Now
👉 Step 1: In Smart Contract
Add this to your stake handler:

rust
Copy
Edit
msg!("Instruction: stake");
msg!("Staking amount: {}", amount);
msg!("owner: {}", ctx.accounts.owner.key());
And similarly for other instructions.

👉 Step 2: Restart Railway
Redeploy your updated smart contract with logging, and restart Railway. It will now properly detect and update staking balances.
